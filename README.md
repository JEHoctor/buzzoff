# BuzzOff

This project creates a list of possible words that can be created from a set of letters.
It is definitely not designed to assist with [The New York Times' Spelling Bee puzzle](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee).
Pinky promise.

## Installation

This project will install the `pyenchant` python package if you request it with `python -m pip install buzzoff[pyenchant]`.
However, you will still need to follow [pyenchant's guide](https://pyenchant.github.io/pyenchant/install.html) on how to install the C library `enchant`.
